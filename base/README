This is a personal respin, it's not officially supported by MX Linux.

This a minimal ISO, in a sense that it contains only the Xfce environment, Firefox and pretty much nothing else, the main objectives were:
 * Keep it under 1GB
 * Preserve most of the MX inhouse developed apps
 * Look and feel like a regular release (without most of the other apps)

It is NOT recommended for newbies and people who want to test MX and benefit from MX extensive testing and package selection. 
This is for people who want to start with a minimal system and are comfortable with installing their own desired packages.

Known bugs (or features?): 
 * Audio is muted by default

If you want a full working system, download the regular MX release, not this one.
If you want even smaller ISO (something that fits on a CD for example) you can get MX CLI which as the name says it’s just big enough to boot to a command line interface (CLI), it doesn’t even have Xorg on it.
