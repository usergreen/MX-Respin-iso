The minimum version is intended for who needs only core components to start with MX Linux.

For users' convenience, I have added here the updated version of MX-21.3_minimal as of 2023-07-25. Be noted that English is default and the only one language supported. For use in other language, you yourself customize it. Also, "dkms" (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) was removed, so install dkms package later if you need it.

The original MX_minimal ISOs are available from below:

Best regards.
