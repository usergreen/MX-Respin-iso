This is a personal respin, it's not officially supported by MX Linux.

This ISO is only for EXPERTS. It boots to CLI (no Xorg, no applications, pretty much nothing). 
It's meant to be a way to install a Linux OS from a CD, or for people to build minimal servers or custom ISOs on top of it. 

User: demo
Password: demo
Root password: root

It comes with 3 important tools: 
 * cli-installer -- a CLI based installer that comes from antiX
 * iso-snapshot-cli -- this is mx-snapshot app stripped down that runs only from CLI; it can create custom ISOs for the running or installed system
 * live-usb-maker -- for burning ISOs, or the current live system to USB drives

Again this is only for experts and people very comfortable with CLI. For a more GUI centric experience but still stripped down use MX Minimal.
If you want a full working system, download the regular MX release, not this one.
