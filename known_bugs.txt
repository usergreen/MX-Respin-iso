This page shows reports about release bugs or errors when confirmed.
---------------------

As for all the releases below:
Sound volume is set to mute as default, but it is not a bug.


As for MATE Desktop (Core):
Not found.

As for MATE Desktop with Extras:
Fixed: LibreOffice does NOT allow Japanese input, too. It was the same as Xfce respin below.(2022-06-02)

As for Xfce Desktop (with Japanese input):
Fixed: LibreOffce does NOT allow Japanese input, therefore searching for a workaround now.(2022-06-01)

----------------------------------------------
The bugs (on 2022-06-01/2022-06-02) has been already fixed as below at 2022-06-02 07:41 UTC.

A workaround was just foud, comparing with Debian 11 bulleseye which does not cause this problem.
It seems that installation of LibreOffice afterwards changed default input settings to
not use uim-anthy anyhow. But re-installing uim-anthy can fix this bag as I tested here.(2022-06-02)

Therefore, I would like to release soon an updating snapshot which will fix this uim-anthy input problem.
