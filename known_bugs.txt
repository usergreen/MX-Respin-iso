As for all the releases below:
Sound volume is set to mute as default, but it is not a bug.

As for MATE Desktop (Core):
Some garbling in Chinese characters (漢字) in Chinese locale. See below.

As for MATE Desktop with Extras:
Missing Spanish locale in snapshot-20220704 (Sorry, I forgot to include this.)

Fixed: LibreOffice does NOT allow Japanese input, too. It was the same as Xfce respin below.(2022-06-02)

As for Xfce Desktop (with Japanese input):
Some garbling in Chinese characters (漢字) in Chinese locale.
Fixed: LibreOffce does NOT allow Japanese input, therefore searching for a workaround now.(2022-06-01)

----------------------------------------------
The bugs (on 2022-06-01/2022-06-02) has been already fixed as below at 2022-06-02 07:41 UTC.
Done: The above problem has already been fixed at the next update release.

A workaround was just found, comparing with Debian 11 bulleseye which does not cause this problem.
It seems that installation of LibreOffice afterwards changed default input settings to
not use uim-anthy anyhow. But re-installing uim-anthy can fix this bug as I tested here.(2022-06-02).
Therefore, I would like to release soon an updating snapshot which will fix this uim-anthy input problem.

-----------------------------------------------
Some garbling in Chinese characters (漢字) in Chinese locale.(2022-06-20)
Under investigation to fix some garbling in Chinese characters (漢字) in Chinese locale.
A fixed version for MATE Extras was released in snapshot-20220704.
As for other versions, there will be available in the updating release.

END.
