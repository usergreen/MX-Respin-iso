This page shows reports about release bugs or errors when confirmed.
---------------------

As for all the releases below:
Sound volume is set to mute as default, but it is not a bug.


As for MATE Desktop (Core):
Not found.

As for MATE Desktop with Extras:
LibreOffce does NOT allow Japanese input, too. it was the same as Xfce respin below.(2022-06-02)

As for Xfce Desktop (with Japanese input):
LibreOffce does NOT allow Japanese input, therefore searching for a turnaroud now.(2022-06-01)

A turnaroud was just foud, comparing Debian 11 bulleseye which does not cause this problem.
It seems that installation of libreoffice afterwards changed default input settings to
not use uim-anthy anyhow. But re-installing uim-anthy can fixthis bag as I tested here.(2022-06-02)

Therefore, I would like to release an updating snapshots which fix this uim-anthy input problem, soon.
