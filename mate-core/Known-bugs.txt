Known problem:

Install launcher icon is sometimes missing on the desktop
in some locales.
Then execute a command as follows,

demo@mx1:~
$ minstall-launcher

But it is fixed anyhow after reboot, and it does not happen again.

As for default or English locale,
The icon is normally exist. No problem.

END.
