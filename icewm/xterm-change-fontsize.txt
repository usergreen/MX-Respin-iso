How to change the default font size of XTerm?

XTerm font is very small. How can I set it larger?


If you don't already have one, create a file in your home directory named .Xresources to store your preferences for various X programs. Append a line to the file such as

xterm*font:     *-fixed-*-*-*-18-*

This informs xterm to use the 'fixed' font at size 18.
