Adopted "Flora Linux" as a new project name

2022-10-19

This is a project to develop Linux distribution based upon Debian and MX Linux.
In short, it is a hybrid re-spin ISO of Debian stabe and MX.
I have adopted a picture of flowers as Desktop wallpaper on the last release, that is why it is named Flora Linux.

After all, this is a derivative of Debian and MX for end users of Linux Desktop.
