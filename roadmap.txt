updated: -------

This page shows my plans for future releases. For example, adding new features, applications, or fix redundancy and bug.


As for MATE Desktop (Core):
Remove pavucontrol package due to redundancy.

As for MATE Desktop with Extras:
Include complete MATE's extra components.
Review default locale to "None".

As for Xfce Desktop (minimal components):
There is no plan now.

END.
