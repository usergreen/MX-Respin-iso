This page shows my plans for future releases.
For example, adding new features, applications, or fix redundancy and bug.


As for MATE Desktop (Core):
Remove pavucontrol package due to redundancy.

As for MATE Desktop with Extras:
Include complete MATE's extra components.
Set default locale to "None".

As for Xfce Desktop (minimal components):
Include several major locales besides EN and JP.
Set default locale to "None".
