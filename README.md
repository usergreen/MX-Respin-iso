# MX-Respin-iso
This is a project to create<br>
an Unofficial MX Respin iso (personally customized snapshots)

ISO image files already created, are distributed at:

https://linux.sakura.ne.jp/mx-respin-iso/

NOTE: In order to get a MX Respin ISO, please visit the above FTP site and download respectively. I can not upload here at github because each size of files is too big to upload.
