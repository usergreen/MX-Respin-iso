### How to set default wallpaper on MX-21 Xfce

The default wallpaper for new users is defined in the file /etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml.

In line 7 of the file 11 you can define the path to the wallpaper that will be used for new users (the image can’t be in your home directory).

Bare in mind that any changes in that file will get overridden after each update of the package manjaro-xfce-settings, so you’ll have to make this change every time a new version of this package gets installed.

cp sample.jpg /usr/share/backgrounds

cat /etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml

Replace all Honesty.jpg with sample.jpg

Change values of strings:
<property name="image-style" type="int" value="5"/>

## Deleting default Honesty.jpg automatically sets Xfce wallpaper of Upstream's.
