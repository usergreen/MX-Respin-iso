This snapshot has designed for users who do not prefer extra applications of GNOME desktop.

This is a reviewed version of the provides release. Yet, the size of ISO image file still remains relatively very smaii.

Removed the leftover of Xfce components from the previous ISO image.

Added file-roller, gnome-screenshot and cups for convenience.

The system has been fully updated so far at the time of this release.

End.
