Updated changelog:

This ISO image mainly includes core components of Xfce Desktop.
Modified from unofficial MX-21.1_minimal_x64.

Added multiple locales along with Chinese and Japanese input.

This edition is relatively a small size and keeps simple. Thus, many basic desktop applications are included besides LibreOffice office suite.

Printer support is missing by mistake. Please install cups and cups-pdf. In the next release, I will include these packages for printer support.
